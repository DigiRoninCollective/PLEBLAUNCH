# PLEBLAUNCH Frontend Best Practices & Next Steps

## 1. Use TypeScript with React
- All React components should use the `.tsx` extension.
- Use type annotations for props and state.

## 2. Modern React Stack
- Use functional components and React hooks.
- Use ES module imports/exports everywhere.
- Consider a UI library for a polished look:
  - [MUI (Material UI)](https://mui.com/)
  - [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
  - [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

## 3. State Management
- For chat and real-time features, use React context or a state library:
  - [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), or [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)

## 4. Real-Time Chat
- Use [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) or [native WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) for real-time chat features.
- Create a `socket.ts` service for managing socket connections.

## 5. Performance
- Use code splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for large components.
- Optimize images and assets.
- Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` for expensive computations.

## 6. TypeScript Strictness
- Keep `"strict": true` in your `tsconfig.json`.
- Use types everywhere for safety and autocompletion.

## 7. Testing
- Use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for unit/integration tests.

## 8. Deployment
- Build your frontend (`npm run build`) and deploy the static output to a CDN or static host (Render, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

**Next Steps:**
- Rename all `.jsx` files to `.tsx` and update imports if needed.
- Install and configure your chosen UI library.
- Set up Socket.IO or WebSocket client for chat.
- Add tests for your main components and logic.

For any of these steps, ask for code examples or setup help!
